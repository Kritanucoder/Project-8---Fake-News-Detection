# Project-8---Fake-News-Detection
This project implements a sophisticated fake news detection system using DistilBERT transformer architecture to classify news articles as authentic or fabricated. The system processes a comprehensive dataset of 44,689 news articles (21,211 true, 23,478 fake) from Kaggle, employing extensive exploratory data analysis including text length distribution, sentiment analysis using TextBlob, and TF-IDF feature extraction. The methodology incorporates advanced preprocessing, word cloud visualization, and lexical diversity analysis to understand linguistic patterns distinguishing fake from authentic news. The deep learning model utilizes DistilBERT tokenization and fine-tuning with PyTorch, achieving exceptional performance with 99.7% accuracy on test data. Key analytical features include polarity and subjectivity scoring, unique word ratio computation, and comprehensive visualization of class distributions. This transformer-based approach demonstrates superior performance in automated misinformation detection, providing a robust solution for combating fake news proliferation in digital media platforms.
